Explore Japan's Earthquake History through Timeline map

This visualization features a selectable timeline, enabling viewers to see earthquake occurrences by year. 
The interactive map provides a detailed and engaging way to explore the geographic distribution and magnitude of earthquakes over time, 
enhancing user understanding through interactive exploration. 

Click on "Select a year" button and it will show a list of different years. 
You can choose any year and it will show you where specifically earthquake hit Japan during that time.

Additionally, if you can't see any red bubbles - then it means that there were no earthquakes during that year. 

I have used D3.js to be able to create this map.
