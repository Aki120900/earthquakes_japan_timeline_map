# Interactive Visualization: Explore Japan's Earthquake History

## Project Description:
This interactive visualization allows viewers to dynamically explore the history of earthquakes in Japan from 1925 to 2024. 
By selecting different years, viewers can see the geographic distribution and magnitude of earthquake occurrences, enhancing their understanding of historical seismic activity in Japan.

## Features: 
- **Interactive Map**: Users can select a year to view earthquake data for that specific year.
- **Geographic Visualization**: Earthquakes are plotted on a map of Japan, with the size of each point representing the magnitude of the earthquake.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes a dropdown menu and slider for easy year selection.
- **User-friendly for Color-Blind Individuals**

## Introduction
This interactive map visualization was created to provide an engaging way to explore Japan's earthquake history. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js to render a dynamic and informative map that updates based on user input.


## Installation
To set up and run this interactive visualization locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/japan-earthquake-history.git
    cd japan-earthquake-history
    ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

OR

**Check website: https://aki120900.github.io/earthquakes_japan_timeline_map/**


## Usage
- **Year Selection**: Use the dropdown menu or slider to select a year. The map will update to display earthquake data for the selected year.
- **Additional Information**: If you are not going to be able to see any red buttons then it means there were no earthquakes during that specific year.

## Data Sources
The earthquake data used in this visualization was sourced from the [NOAA Hazards database](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/search). The data was cleaned and processed to fit the requirements of the interactive map.
